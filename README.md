# Project overview (using SQL)

In this project, I conducted a series of SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database to manage and analyze employee and department data.

I designed an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) using QuickDBD to visualize data relationships and structure the database efficiently. 
<p> The process involved:

* Creating a schema and building six tables for employees, departments, and related entities.
* Defining primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and establish connections between tables.
* Importing data and performing structured queries for in-depth analysis.

## Project Structure:

* **"EmployeeSQL" Folder**: Contains the ERM diagram, schema scripts, and analysis code.
* **"data files" Folder**: Houses the schema creation and data analysis scripts.

## Key SQL Concepts and Techniques:

* **SELECT** for data retrieval
* **JOIN** to combine related tables
* **WHERE** for filtering records
* **GROUP BY** for aggregating data
* **ORDER BY** for sorting results

## Results & Insights:
This project demonstrates my ability to design a robust relational database and execute complex queries to extract actionable business insights from employee and department data. The analysis supports operational decision-making and provides a solid foundation for financial forecasting.

### Key Metrics for Enhanced Workforce Analysis
To deliver a comprehensive headcount and workforce analysis, I'm expanding (work in progress) the framework to include the following key metrics:

* **Current Headcount**: Total employees segmented by department, role, and region.
* **New Hires Forecast**: Projected hiring per department and location for the next 12 months.
* **Attrition Forecast**: Estimated employee turnover based on historical data.
* **Total Headcount Projection**: Forecasted overall workforce size over the next 12 months.
* **Salary and Benefits Cost Projection**: Estimated payroll expenses aligned with hiring plans.

### Calculating KPI Metrics
In addition to the above metrics, I'm calculating (work in progress) the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide deeper insights:

* **Historic Average Hiring Rates by Department**: Analyzing the number of new hires in each department over the past three years to determine average annual hiring rates. This departmental focus accounts for unique growth patterns and resource needs, enabling targeted recruitment strategies.

* **Average Historic Attrition Rates by Department**: Calculating attrition by dividing the number of employees who left each department by the average number of employees in that department over the same three-year period. This approach highlights specific retention challenges within departments, facilitating tailored interventions.

### Importance of Quarterly Forecasts
While the analysis includes annual metrics, it's advisable for companies to perform **quarterly forecasts**. By examining average KPIs from corresponding quarters over the past three years, organizations can **address seasonality** and make more accurate predictions. Seasonal trends can significantly impact workforce dynamics, and quarterly analyses enable businesses to anticipate and respond to these fluctuations effectively.

### Focus on Recent Data
The decision to focus on the past three years stems from significant market shifts in the post-pandemic era. Trends from this period are more relevant to our current analysis than older data, ensuring that our insights and projections align with the present economic landscape.

### Scenario-Based Workforce Planning
To enhance the robustness of our analysis, incorporating scenario-based workforce planning is essential. This involves developing multiple scenarios—such as rapid growth, economic downturns, or unexpected attrition—to assess potential impacts on staffing needs and prepare contingency plans accordingly. This approach showcases the ability to navigate uncertainties and make informed decisions.

<p> To further refine forecasting accuracy, incorporating variance analysis is key. By regularly comparing forecasted figures with actual outcomes, organizations can identify discrepancies, understand their root causes, and fine-tune future predictions, ultimately leading to more precise and adaptable workforce planning.

### Advanced Metrics and KPIs
Expanding the analysis to include additional key performance indicators provides deeper insights into workforce dynamics:

* **Time-to-Hire**: Measuring the average duration required to fill open positions helps identify bottlenecks in the recruitment process.

* **Internal Mobility Rate**: Tracking the percentage of employees transitioning between roles within the organization reflects opportunities for career development and effective talent utilization.

* **Absenteeism Rate**: Monitoring unplanned absences gauges employee engagement and potential productivity impacts.

### Integration of Financial Metrics
Incorporating financial data is crucial to assess the economic implications of headcount changes:

* **Fully Burdened Labor Rate**: Calculating the total cost of an employee, including salary, benefits, and overhead, provides insight into the financial impact of staffing decisions.

* **Cost of Labor**: Analyzing labor costs as a percentage of revenue evaluates operational efficiency and informs budgeting decisions.

### Dynamic Headcount Planning
Transitioning from static annual planning to a dynamic, continuous approach allows for regular updates to forecasts, reflecting real-time data. This enables proactive adjustments to hiring plans in response to market fluctuations or internal changes.

### Visualization and Reporting
Enhancing the project with clear, insightful visualizations aids in data interpretation:

* **Dashboards**: Developing interactive dashboards that display key metrics and trends facilitates quick comprehension and data-driven decision-making.

* **Scenario Simulations**: Visualizing the outcomes of different workforce scenarios allows for comparison of potential impacts and supports strategic planning.

### Data Quality and Compliance
Emphasizing the importance of data accuracy and regulatory compliance ensures the reliability and legality of the analysis:

* **Data Validation**: Implementing processes to ensure the integrity and reliability of data inputs is critical for accurate forecasting.

* **Regulatory Adherence**: Staying informed about labor laws and industry regulations ensures that headcount strategies align with legal requirements.

Integrating these elements provides deeper insights into how departmental headcount variations impact revenue. This data-driven approach can help establish more informed hiring priorities and optimize workforce planning.
