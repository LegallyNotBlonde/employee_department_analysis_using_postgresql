# Project overview (using SQL)

In this project, I performed a series of SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database to manage and analyze employee and department data.

I designed an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) using QuickDBD to visualize data relationships and structure the database efficiently. The process involved:

* Creating a schema and building six tables for employees, departments, and related entities.
* Defining primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and establish connections between tables.
* Importing data and performing structured queries for in-depth analysis.

## Project Structure:

* **"EmployeeSQL" Folder** - Contains the ERM diagram, schema scripts, and analysis code.
* **"full_code" File** – Combines both the schema creation and data analysis into a single comprehensive SQL script.

## Key SQL Concepts and Techniques:

* **SELECT** for data retrieval
* **JOIN** to combine related tables
* **WHERE** for filtering records
* **GROUP BY** for aggregating data
* **ORDER BY** for sorting results

## Results & Insights:
This project demonstrates my ability to design a robust relational database and execute complex queries to extract actionable business insights from employee and department data. The analysis not only supports operational decision-making but also provides a strong foundation for financial forecasting.

### For a more impactful headcount and workforce analysis, I recommend expanding the framework to include the following key metrics:

* **Current Headcount** – Total employees segmented by department, role, and region.
* **New Hires Forecast** – Projected hiring per department and location for the next 12 months.
* **Attrition Forecast** – Estimated employee turnover based on historical data.
* **Total Headcount Projection** – Forecasted overall workforce size over the next 12 months.
* **Salary and Benefits Cost Projection** – Estimated payroll expenses aligned with hiring plans.

Integrating these metrics—along with additional analyses such as employee retention rates and revenue correlation studies (supported by **statistical assessments like P values and confidence intervals**)—would provide deeper insights into how **departmental headcount variations impact revenue**. This data-driven approach can help establish more informed hiring priorities and optimize workforce planning.

* *Note: The dataset used in this project is entirely fictional and was designed to demonstrate my ability to work with multiple data sources, creating structured datasets that could support headcount planning and operational expense forecasting. No real employee or company data was used.*
