# üß† Project Overview (Using SQL)

* In this project, I designed and analyzed a PostgreSQL relational database to explore employee and department data, identify workforce trends, and support future headcount planning.

* I used QuickDBD to design the schema and created SQL queries that uncover actionable insights and calculate KPIs to support both operational and strategic workforce decisions.

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SELECT`            | Extracts specific data from one or more tables                                 |
| `JOIN`              | Combines data across related tables                                             |
| `WHERE`             | Filters records based on defined conditions                                     |
| `GROUP BY`          | Aggregates data into meaningful groups                                          |

## üîç General Workforce Trend Analysis (Current State)
Using SQL, I analyzed workforce structure across all available years to explore hiring patterns, role distribution, and department dynamics. These findings help businesses:

* Identify headcount trends  
* Evaluate organizational structure  
* Understand how roles and salaries are distributed  
* Compare departments by workforce size, cost, and manager coverage

### üìå Sample Insights

| **Observation**                                          | **What It Tells Us**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The largest department has the lowest number of managers | Suggests possible leadership or oversight imbalance                                 |
| Salary varies within the same job title                  | Highlights potential pay inconsistencies or misalignment in leveling                |
| Some departments have no managers assigned               | Indicates possible data issues or management gaps                                   |
| Regional headcount distribution is uneven                | Helps inform HR allocation and support planning                                     |

## üìà Forecasting Workforce Needs (3-Year Focus)

To support headcount forecasting, I narrowed the analysis to the last **three years**, reflecting more recent trends shaped by post-pandemic market changes.

These recent trends provide a more realistic basis for hiring projections, attrition planning, and financial estimates.

## üß¨ Source

The original dataset was created using  [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/), (2022), a realistic data generation tool. To enable deeper analysis, I extended the dataset using structured randomization techniques in Excel. These included adding realistic ranges for dates, salaries, benefits, regions, and employment status.

<p> Although synthetic, the data was shaped to reflect patterns seen in real-world HR systems, enabling meaningful and practical workforce analysis.
