# Project overview (using SQL)

In this project, I performed a series of SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database to manage and analyze employee and department data.

I designed an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) using QuickDBD to visualize data relationships and structure the database efficiently. The process involved:

Creating a schema and building six tables for employees, departments, and related entities.
Defining primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and establish connections between tables.
Importing data and performing structured queries for in-depth analysis.

## Project Structure:
* **"EmployeeSQL" Folder** - Contains the ERM diagram, schema scripts, and analysis code.
* **"full_code" File** â€“ Combines both the schema creation and data analysis into a single comprehensive SQL script.

## Key SQL Concepts Used:
* **SELECT** for data retrieval
* **JOIN** to combine related tables
* **WHERE** for filtering records
* **GROUP BY** for aggregating data
* **ORDER BY** for sorting results

## Results & Insights:
Through this project, I demonstrated the ability to design a relational database, manage complex data relationships, and execute efficient queries to extract meaningful business insights from employee and department data.

* *Note: The dataset used in this project is entirely fictional and was designed to demonstrate my ability to work with multiple data sources, creating structured datasets that could support headcount planning and operational expense forecasting. No real employee or company data was used.*
