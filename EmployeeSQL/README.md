# sql-challenge-overview

In this project, I performed a series of SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database containing employee and department data. I created a diagram and a schema using the QuickDBD tool. After creating and importing data into six tables, I set primary and foreign keys to connect the tables and extract the needed information.

The diagram, schema for creating tables, and the code for analyzing the data can be found in the folder "EmployeeSQL". The file "full_code" contains both the "schema" and "analysis" codes combined into one.

These queries allowed me to effectively manage and analyze employee and department data using PostgreSQL. I utilized various SQL clauses like SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to extract specific information and understand data relationships.
